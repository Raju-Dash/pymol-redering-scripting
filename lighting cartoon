Lighting
ambient (float 0.0-1.0, default: 0.14) controls the ambient lighting level.
ambient_occlusion_mode (integer, default: 0) Controls which method is used to draw ambient occlusion. 0=disabled, 1=atom-based occlusion, 2=triangle-based occlusion
ambient_occlusion_scale (float, default: 25.0) The scale by which ambient occlusion values are modified. The larger this value the more hinting is applied.
ambient_occlusion_smooth (int, default: 10) Controls whether or not ambient occlusion uses smoothing of nearby values.
cgo_lighting (boolean, default: 1) controls whether or not PyMOL lights CGOs.
direct (float 0.0-1.0, default: 0.45) is the amount of light being emitted from the camera.
edit_light (integer 1-8, default: 1) This setting controls which light may be moved by the mouse.
light (vector, default: [ -0.4, -0.4, -1.0]) is the direction of movable light source 1.
light2 (vector, default: [ -0.55, -0.7, 0.15]) is the direction of movable light source 2.
light3 (vector, default: [ 0.3, -0.6, -0.2]) is the direction of movable light source 3.
light4 (vector, default: [ -1.2, 0.3, -0.2]) is the direction of movable light source 4.
light5 (vector, default: [ 0.3, 0.6, -0.75]) is the direction of movable light source 5.
light6 (vector, default: [ -0.3, 0.5, 0.0]) is the direction of movable light source 6.
light7 (vector, default: [ 0.9, -0.1, -0.15]) is the direction of movable light source 7.
light8 (vector, default: [ 1.3, 2.0, 0.8]) is the direction of movable light source 8.
light9 (vector, default: [ -1.7, -0.5, 1.2]) is the direction of movable light source 9.
light_count (integer 1-10, default: 2) is the number of light sources including the camera source.
power (float, default: 1.0) is the reflect exponent for light emitted by the camera.
shininess (float, default: 55.0) is the specular exponent for the movable light sources.
reflect (float 0-1.0, default: 0.45) controls the aggregate intensity of the movable light sources.
reflect_power (float, default: 1.0) controls the reflective exponent for the movable light sources.
spec_count (integer, default: -1) controls how many movable light sources are used when drawing specular reflections.
spec_direct (float, default: 0.0) controls the specular intensity for the camera light source.
spec_direct_power (float, default: 55.0) controls the specular exponent for camera light source.
specular (float, default: 1.0) controls the specular intensity for movable light sources.
specular_intensity (float, default: 0.5) controls the specular intensity for movable light sources, if specular is set to 1.0.
two_sided_lighting (boolean, default: on) controls whether both faces of a triangle are lit or just the front face (as defined by convention).
